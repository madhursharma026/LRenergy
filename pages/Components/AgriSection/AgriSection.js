                        <h5>Use of LR Agri products help microorganisms become active and diverse in the soil. This results in enriching the land-ecosystem and increasing earthworms. LR Agri products together with organic matter accelerates decomposition of hummus, thus softening the soil. This improves water and nutrient retention.</h5>

                        <h3 className="mt-4 text-center">Replant failure</h3>
                        <h5>LR Agri products diversifies micro biomes in the soil. This inhibits the increase in specific microorganisms including pathogens, thereby reducing the risk of replant failure.</h5>
                        <h3 className="mt-4 text-center">Measures against salt damage</h3>
                        <h5>Concurrent use of LR Agri products and added organic matter speeds up decomposition. It improves both the physical and chemical properties of soil, while sharpening its buffering capacity. These measures guard against salt damage in maritime environments.</h5>
                        <h3 className="mt-4 text-center">Increasing harvests</h3>
                        <h5>LR Agri products helps plants grow well. This leads to yield increases, longer cultivation periods, and high quality crops. Together, these improvements lead to richer harvests.</h5>
                        <h3 className="mt-4 text-center">Producing crops with added value</h3>
                        <h5>It is said that our vegetables contain much less nutritional value compared with those grown fifty years ago. However, LR Agri vegetables have high nutritional value and increased sugar content, which improves their taste and allows them to be preserved longer.</h5>

                        <h5>LR Agri products are composed of naturally-derived microorganisms, which are safe and eco-friendly. It is not necessary to put on goggles, masks, and protective clothing when spraying LR Culture. Similarly, LR Agri products never pollutes water systems.</h5>
                        <h3 className="mt-4 text-center">Lowering environmental burden</h3>
                        <h5>LR Agri products manufactured from naturally-derived material. It is easy to be decomposed after use, and, therefore, LR Agri products never pollutes groundwater. Instead, it purifies soil, groundwater, lakes and rivers, thereby reducing environmental burdens.</h5>
